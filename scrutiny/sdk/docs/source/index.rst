The Scrutiny Python SDK (Software Development Kit) is a Python module letting you programmatically interact with a Scrutiny Server. Its main purpose is to allow automated interact with a device to 
enable Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) testing, End-Of-Line (EOL) configuration and complex debugging sequence.

Since the design of the Scrutiny Debugger Server is multi-client, it is possible to run a script (or multiples) while monitoring the connected device with the GUI.
