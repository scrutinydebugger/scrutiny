The Scrutiny Python Software Development Kit (SDK) is a Python module that facilitates programmatic interaction with a Scrutiny Server. 
Its primary function is to automate interactions with a device, thereby enabling Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) testing, End-Of-Line (EOL) 
configuration, and complex debugging sequences.

Given the multi-client design of the Scrutiny Debugger Server, it is possible to execute one or multiple scripts while concurrently 
monitoring the connected device via the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
